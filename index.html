        <h2>First Indian Female Astronaut</h2>
        <p>
          <span>Kalpana Chawla</span> (17 March 1962 â€“ 1 February
          2003) was an Indian-born American astronaut and engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to go to
          space. She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm
          operator. Her second flight was on STS-107, the final flight of Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003. She was
          one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft
          disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. She was posthumously awarded the
          Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and several streets, universities, and institutions have been named in her
          honor. She is regarded as a national hero in India. She died on 1 February 2003.
